# The new simple solution to creating [HuskyCrates](https://github.com/codeHusky/HuskyCrates-Sponge) config files!

This is just in the conceptual stages right now. Check back later for more updates.

This will be programmed for the Java Runtime Environment and will run in GUI Forms. All optional features for crates and items will be available in this program, including new ones whenever new options are added to HuskyCrates!
Soon to come as well, easy config editing for item additions, editing, and deletion.
